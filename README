PEACH Content Management Framework

Requirements:

 - PHP 5.x
 - PEAR
 - PEAR_DB
 - PEAR_Log
 - PEAR_Auth
 - HTML_Template_Flexy
 - HTML_QuickForm
 - Propel
 
Installation:

If you've got this copy from cvs, first do a 'cvs up -dP', this will remove any empty directories.

For now only the simple installer is available,
eventually peach will be build by using the phing system.

PEACH consists of two parts, the PEACH library and an installer which
will create the filesystem structure for you website.

To install PEACH just run install.sh in the installer/simple directory.

This will create the basic site in the directory you have specified.
This directory should be accessible from your webserver.

PEACH also requires the PEAR core libraries to be installed, along
with some packages mentioned above, make sure you've installed these.

Some App's can run without Propel installed, so it's not absolutely necessary to install it.
